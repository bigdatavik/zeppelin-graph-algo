Triangle Count determines the number of triangles \npassing through each node in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes,\nwhere each node has a relationship to all other nodes. Triangle Count can also be run\nglobally for evaluating our overall dataset.\n\nThe goal of the Clustering Coefficient algorithm is to measure how tightly a group is\nclustered compared to how tightly it could be clustered. The algorithm uses Triangle\nCount in its calculations, which provides a ratio of existing triangles to possible relationships.\nA maximum value of 1 indicates a clique where every node is connected to\nevery other node.\n",
